## Wave Basics

What is a wave? How many types of waves are there? Why are they useful?

$\rightarrow$ **Wave:** transfer of energy without matter (by transmission of oscillations):

* Mechanical: oscillations of the medium.

* Electromagnetic: oscillations of fields (electrical or magnetic).

### Analysis of a Wave

* Displacement $x$ ($m$): distance to the equilibrium (average) position.

* Amplitude $A$ ($m$): maximum displacement of a wave.

* Frequency $f$ (Hertz $Hz$): number of cycles through a point per second.

* Wavelength $\lambda$ ($m$): distance between 2 equal waypoints (eg 2 peaks). @fig-wave1

* Period $T$ ($s$): time for 1 full oscillation or wavelength. @fig-wave2

* Phase $\theta$ (rad): stage of wave at a point (~ angle around a circle, we will see it...).

* Wave speed $v$ ($m/s$): $v = \frac{d}{t}$ and also $v =f\lambda$ (Wave equation)

* Pulse-echo measurements (like bat and dolphin echolocation): emit a pulse of ultrasound (50-100kHz) and calculate $d=vt/2$ (rebound).

_Checkpoint questions_. (Extra: Read the experiment p.91, draw the wave diagram).

**Answers**

1. Graph from top to bottom: $0.2 m$, $80 m$, $5.5 m$.

2. $1240 m$ ($d = v\cdot t$)

3. $8.5\cdot 10^{14} Hz$ ($f = c/\lambda$, wave equation)

4. As frequency is defined as waves per second, multipliying frequency by wavelenght is equivalent as dividing distance by time (velocity)

5. Student's own answers using $v = f\cdot \lambda$.
    Eg. estimated wavelenght is $5 m$, estimated frequency is 1 wave every 3 seconds, so $f = 0.33 Hz$. $v = f\cdot \lambda = 0.33\times 5 = 1.7 m\hspace{1mm}s^{-1}$

## Wave types

### By oscillation plane
According to the oscillation plane, compared with wave displacement, we find transverse and longitudinal waves. 

Do you know what transverse and longitudinal means?

![Transverse and longitudinal planes](images/trans_long_wave.png){#fig-trans_long_wave width=60%}

$\rightarrow$ Transverse wave: motion is perpendicular to displacement (up/down). Eg ropes, electromagnetic waves (light), earthquake S-waves.

$\rightarrow$ Longitudinal wave: motion is parallel to displacement (front-back). Eg sound waves (compressions vs rarefactions), earthquake P-waves.

Both kinds of waves are represented in the same graphs.

- Compression: area at higher pressure (molecules closer together).

- Rarefaction: area at lower pressure (molecules further apart).

_Minipractical:_ flick a string on top of the table and let it stop. Waves should remain visible. Measure the time for 10 “flicks” (oscillations) to calculate the frequency ($\frac{1}{T}$), and with a ruler the amplitude and wavelength. From this calculate the speed.
